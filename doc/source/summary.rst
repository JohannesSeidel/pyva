Summary
-------

In the :ref:`sec-creating_models` section many applications of pyva were shown.
Typical designs of acoustic piping, absorption, isolation and complex room-wall configurations 
are presented. Most examples are academic but with a link to practical applications.

In the near future a further extension of pyva to more realistic systems and a graphical representation
is planned. However, contributions from the acoustic community is highly appreciated.
