Creating Models
===============

The aim of pyva is to simulate vibroacoustic systems. Thus, the main purpose is to 
create such models and to perform a simulation. In this section several applications
for each model class of the :mod:`pyva.models` module will be presented in combination with an application.

The full code of all examples can be found in :ref:`sec-code-examples`
