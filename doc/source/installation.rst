Installation
------------

The pyva package is hosted on github and can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/minipief/pyva

The related github link of the repository is https://github.com/minipief/pyva.git

Unfortunately the name pyva is already used in the Python Package Index and the PyPi name varies from module name. 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install pyva-toolbox
   
If you would like to install the latest version on the git server you may use:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install git+https://github.com/minipief/pyva.git
