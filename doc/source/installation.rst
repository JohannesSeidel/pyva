Installation
------------

The pyva package is hosted on github and can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/minipief/pyva

The related github link of the repository is https://github.com/minipief/pyva.git

Unfortunately the name pyva is already used for a different package in PyPi. 
But as alternative you can download the pyva wheel from here https://github.com/minipief/pyva/tree/main/dist and install via:

If not already available install the wheel package by

.. code-block:: console

   pip install wheel
   
The required package can then be installed via 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install pyva-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
