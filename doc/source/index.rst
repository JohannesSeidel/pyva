Vibro Acoustic [All2009] Package - pyva
========================================

The pyva [#f1]_ package provides typical routines to calculate and predict the **vibroacoustics** of technical systems 
using deterministic e.g. (FEM), random (SEA) and  the combination of both hybrid FEM/SEA.

It is a **Py**\ thon library for **V**\ ibro\ **a**\ coustic [All2009] using numpy, scipy and matplotlib.



All examples, systems and models from the book **Vibroacoustic [All2009] - An Introduction to SEA and hybrid methods** [Pei2022]_ are created using this toolbox.
