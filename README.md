Python toolbox for vibroacoustics

This toolbox is the code extension for the book 
A. Peiffer: Vibroacoustic Simulation: In Introduction to Statistical Energy Analysis and Hybrid Methods, John Wiley, 2022

https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Vibroacoustic+Simulation%3A+An+Introduction+to+Statistical+Energy+Analysis+and+Hybrid+Methods-p-9781119849841

This toolbox allows the reader to follow the examples in the book and people that are interested in vibroacoustic simulation with a focus on 
statistical energy analysis (SEA) and hybrid methods (hybrid FEM/SE), to perform SEA simulation without heavy licence costs.
